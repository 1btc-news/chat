# Fullcoiner Chat

### Introduction

This documentation provides an in-depth understanding of the Fullcoiner Chat platform. The Fullcoiner Chat is a platform uniquely designed for Bitcoin holders with at least one full coin. This community has never been organized before, and this platform gives them a space to collaborate and share narratives, ensuring their voices are the strongest value signal.

### Comparison with other platforms

Fullcoiner Chat differs from other social platforms like Discord and Telegram, which require traditional authentication methods. Instead, Fullcoiner Chat emphasizes a wallet-first approach, meaning your cryptocurrency address doubles as your identity within the chat. This approach enables users to maintain pseudonymity while focusing on privacy and security.

### Verifying a Fullcoiner

To ensure the integrity of the platform, it's essential to verify that a user controls at least one Bitcoin. This is achieved through the following process:

1. **Login**: Users must log in using either a Hiro or Xverse wallet, which are leaders in emerging BTC standards on the web and have undergone independent auditing and verification.
2. **Send Dust Transaction**: Users send a minimal amount of Bitcoin, known as "dust," to a generated address. The dust transaction cryptographically links the two accounts, verifying the sender's ownership. The funds remain in the user's primary wallet. Users are advised not to move these funds after the dust transaction to retain their verified status.
3. **Verification**: The address to send the dust to is automatically generated by the API. The API monitors this address for the dust transaction. Upon receipt of the dust, the balance is verified, and the API marks the associated account as verified. If the Bitcoin is ever spent from this address, the verified status is removed, revoking access to the chat.

### Security and Privacy

Fullcoiner Chat places high priority on security. Using a dust transaction ensures the majority of the user's funds stay in the main wallet, while employing a separate wallet for the login account further reduces risk. Users are encouraged to inspect all transactions to prevent potential security issues.

However, there are inherent privacy concerns. Bitcoin transactions are not private and can be traced, which might expose user identities. To mitigate these concerns, users could consider transferring their Bitcoin to and from an exchange or using privacy-enhancing techniques such as CoinJoin.

### Independent Verification and API Usage

All data related to dust transactions and account verifications can be independently verified, ensuring transparency and integrity in the Fullcoiner Chat community.
