# 1BTC Chat FAQ

> Why create a chat for fullcoiners?

This is a group that has never organized before. They have the strongest value signal. They can work together to tell their own narrative.

> Why not just use Discord / Telegram / etc?

Discord and Telegram require legacy authentication. We want to focus on a wallet first approach. Your crypto address = your identity in the chat. Allows for pseudonymity. Focus on privacy and security.

> What is the process for verifying a fullcoiner?

To demontrate at least 1BTC is under an account's control:

1. Log in with a Hiro or Xverse wallet
2. Send a dust amount of Bitcoin (explain) to the generated address
3. The account logged in via Hiro/Xverse gains access
4. Do not move the funds to retain access

_do they have to consolidate UTXOs first?_

> Why use Hiro/Xverse wallets for login?

Leaders on emerging BTC standards on the web. Independently audited and verified.

> Why send a dust amount of BTC?

This cryptographically links the two accounts. The funds remain in your wallet of choice. From there, the new account becomes verified.

> What happens after sending the dust?

The address to send dust to is automatically generated by the API. The API monitors the address for the dust transaction. Once the dust is received, the balance is verified, and the API marks the associated account as verified. If the Bitcoin is ever spent, that status is removed, revoking access to the chat.

> Are there any security concerns?

Using a dust transaction ensures funds don't leave the main wallet. Using a separate wallet for the login account ensures funds aren't at risk. Always inspect all transactions.

> Are there any privacy concerns?

Bitcoin transactions are not private and can be traced. Transferring to and from an exchange is one option. Using CoinJoin as a privacy-enhancing technique.

> Can the data be independently verified?

Yes?

> Can anyone use the API?

I think so?
